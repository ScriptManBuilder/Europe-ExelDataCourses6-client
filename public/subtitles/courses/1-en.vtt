00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to Excel Data Visualization Part 2: Advanced Demos.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
By now you're probably a master of just about every chart type

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that Excel has to offer. So let's turn things up a notch.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In this section, we're going to dive into some really unique,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
advanced, next-level data visualization exercises.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But before we do, let's take a minute to set some expectations.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Number one: Advanced charts and graphs often require

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the use of advanced formulas and functions. At the end of the day,

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that's what makes them advanced. This isn't a formulas course,

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
you came here to learn data visualization. But formulas and functions

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
are critical components to enable really cool functionality

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with advanced charts and graphs. During the demos, I'll talk about

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the formulas and give you quick summaries, but it won't be

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a comprehensive review. Second: Some of these demos are easy,

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
some might be hard. All I ask is that you proceed with an open mind

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and trust me, you'll emerge as a data visualization wizard.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Last but not least, if you want to step up your formula game

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and learn more about functions like SUMIFS, INDEX MATCH, OFFSET,

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
COUNTA, array functions and more, consider taking

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
an advanced Excel formulas course. With that said,

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
let's go ahead and get started with our first demo.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Get ready to create stunning, dynamic visualizations

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that will transform how you present data in Excel.
