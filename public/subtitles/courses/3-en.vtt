00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this demo, we'll explore adding binary values to highlight

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
specific date ranges within your charts. Head to the Binary Date

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Ranges tab in your workbook. Here we have daily revenue data

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and certain dates are highlighted in light green. These represent

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
promotional or sale periods. We want to showcase these special

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
date ranges directly in our visualization. First, let's create

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a basic line chart from our data. Then add a new column called

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Promo with a default value of zero. Now replace zero with one

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
for dates that fall within promotional periods. This creates

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a binary series: zero for regular dates, one for promo dates.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Add this series to your chart, then convert it to a combo chart

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with 100% stacked columns on a secondary axis. Format the promo

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
series with a light fill and remove the gap width. This creates

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
vertical bands highlighting your promotional periods. Finally,

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
hide the secondary axis using custom formatting with three

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
semicolons. Now you have an elegant way to feature specific

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
date ranges within your Excel charts without overwhelming

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the visualization with too much information.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yes, copywriting. But what is copywriting exactly?

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Is it more of an art or a science? And what are the tools,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
techniques and formulas you'll need to know to really

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
start building momentum as a respected

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and in-demand copywriter. These are the questions you often hear

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
from those who are interested in pursuing copywriting

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
as an exciting career change. And in this

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
straightforward and easy-to-follow masterclass, I'll show you

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the exact strategies I followed to be able to make

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
huge strides in six months of starting as a freelance

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
copywriter. These accomplishments include becoming the number

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
one health and wellness copywriter on Google, being featured

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in a case study interview with top copywriter

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Jacob McMillan. And receiving awesome feedback like

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this one from none other than Craig Clemens, who has generated more than

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
1 billion dollars in sales through the art of copywriting.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But you might be thinking, what would I actually learn

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in this course? Well, for starters, you'll

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
get access to over 60 lessons, each one to ten minutes

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to make them simpler, more memorable and hopefully

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
more motivating to spur you into action. The lessons

and five story structures you can use
