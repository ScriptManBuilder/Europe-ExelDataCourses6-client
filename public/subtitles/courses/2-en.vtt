00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's kick things off with something unique and creative:

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Custom Image Overlay Charts. In your workbook,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
head to the Image Overlay Charts tab. We have basic fundraising data:

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
dollars raised, goal amount, and percent to goal.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Instead of creating a standard stacked column chart,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we'll integrate custom graphics. I've built two examples:

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a thermometer and a thumbs up icon. You can use any graphic you choose.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Just make sure it has a solid opaque background and transparent area

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
where you want the chart to shine through. Let's insert

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a 100% stacked column chart with our data. Format the chart:

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
remove the title, remove the X axis, make the remaining portion transparent

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and give our progress a solid fill color. Now align the chart

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
with your graphic so 0% and 100% marks line up perfectly.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Remove unnecessary elements like the Y axis and grid lines.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Reduce the gap width to make the series fill the entire chart area.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now right-click and send the chart behind your graphic.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The chart shines through only where the graphic is transparent.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
As you change the fundraising value, the visualization updates

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
dynamically. It's a simple but creative effect that makes

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
your dashboards stand out. You can apply this technique

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to any graphic with transparent areas to create engaging,

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
professional-looking data visualizations in Excel.
